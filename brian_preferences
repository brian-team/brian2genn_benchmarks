[logging]

# What log level to use for the log written to the console.
# 
# Has to be one of CRITICAL, ERROR, WARNING, INFO, DEBUG or DIAGNOSTIC.

console_log_level = 'ERROR'

# Whether to log to a file or not.
# 
# If set to ``True`` (the default), logging information will be written
# to a file. The log level can be set via the `logging.file_log_level`
# preference.

file_log = False

# Whether to save a copy of the script that is run.
#
# If set to ``True`` (the default), a copy of the currently run script
# is saved to a temporary location. It is deleted after a successful
# run (unless `logging.delete_log_on_exit` is ``False``) but is kept after
# an uncaught exception occured. This can be helpful for debugging,
# in particular when several simulations are running in parallel.

save_script = False

# Whether or not to redirect stdout/stderr to null at certain places.
# 
# This silences a lot of annoying compiler output, but will also hide
# error messages making it harder to debug problems. You can always
# temporarily switch it off when debugging. If
# `logging.std_redirection_to_file` is set to ``True`` as well, then the
# output is saved to a file and if an error occurs the name of this file
# will be printed.

std_redirection = True

# Whether to redirect stdout/stderr to a file.
# 
# If both ``logging.std_redirection`` and this preference are set to
# ``True``, all standard output/error (most importantly output from
# the compiler) will be stored in files and if an error occurs the name
# of this file will be printed. If `logging.std_redirection` is ``True``
# and this preference is ``False``, then all standard output/error will
# be completely suppressed, i.e. neither be displayed nor stored in a
# file.
# 
# The value of this preference is ignore if `logging.std_redirection` is
# set to ``False``.

std_redirection_to_file = True
